Key Features:

Player Activity Analysis:
Track daily, weekly, and monthly active players (DAU, WAU, MAU).
Analyze session duration distribution.
Identify peak hours and days of player activity.

Gameplay Metrics:
Aggregate gameplay statistics such as matches played, levels completed, achievements unlocked, etc.
Analyze difficulty levels and player progression across different stages.

Player Engagement:
Calculate retention rates and churn analysis.
Segment players based on engagement levels (e.g., casual, regular, hardcore).
Identify features or events that drive engagement (e.g., in-game events, new updates).

Monetization Analysis:
Track in-game purchases, virtual goods sales, and revenue generated.
Analyze average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) and lifetime value (LTV) of players.

Social Interaction:
Analyze social features such as chat usage, guild formation, friend invitations, etc.
Track social engagement metrics and their impact on player retention.

Performance Monitoring:
Monitor game performance metrics such as server response times, latency, and uptime.
